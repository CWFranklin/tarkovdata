## SVG Maps

This map data is meant to provide the community and community tools with the basics for creating new, source shared maps. These maps are meant to be SVGs, so friendly to utilize with on the web for things like overlaying quest locations, spawns, extracts and more. They are stil a work in progress, and final formats may be subject to change
Please open a discussion if you have any questions or want any direction on how you could contribute!

Some general guidelines for the maps:
- They should be entirely SVG drawn, no imported images
- They should be as close to the in-game maps as possible, when available
- They should not include labels
- They should not include every detail, but just major landmarks
- If the map requires multiple floors to be useful (Interchange), each floor should be a parent level layer
- Please include any source file if available in addition to the final SVG
- Please utilize current color scheme for any new maps, if you want to utilize the maps with a different color scheme, coordinated colors can easily be replaced as a post-processing step.
