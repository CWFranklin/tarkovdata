## SVG Maps

This map data is meant to provide the community and community tools with the basics for creating new, source shared maps. These maps are meant to be SVGs, so friendly to utilize with on the web for things like overlaying quest locations, spawns, extracts and more. They are stil a work in progress, and final formats may be subject to change
Please open a discussion if you have any questions or want any direction on how you could contribute!

Some general guidelines for the maps:
- They should be entirely SVG drawn, no imported images
- They should be as close to the in-game maps as possible, when available
- They should not include labels
- They should not include every detail, but just major landmarks
- They should not split floors into separate spaces (ideally splitting things like Interchange into multiple maps, one per floor)
- Please include any source file if available
